# The Hallucinate Girl

* July 18, 2024 ✨

This story is about my college days and a special female friend. One day, without a word, she disappeared from college life. Her sudden departure left a deep void in my life. I searched for her tirelessly, trying everything I could to find her, but everything was in rain. I began to hallucinate her presence, seeing her in familiar places and hearing her voice in my mind. The pain of missing her was overwhelming. Her memory haunted me every day. **"The Hallucinate Girl"** captures the emotional journey of losing a dear friend and the lingering impact she has on my heart.

Today, on **July 18th, 2024**, as I reflect on this story, I remember her with both smile and pain.

This story is never-ending one, but I write it as much as possible—as a friend, as a human, as a true lover from my perspective.

on **October 19, 2022** my journey at a private engineering college began. The first day was nerve-wracking, filled with excitement and a hint of uncertainty. As classes began, I eagerly connected with new friends, each face bringing a sense of companionship and new hope to my college journey.

After a few days, November began, and that's when I met her. She was always helpful but quiet, as if she carried a story she didn't want to share with anyone. Sometimes I would ask, but she never told me the story. And so life went on. November passed, then December, and and so on. Her untold story lingering in the background.

On **August 30, 2023**, we had our final conversation, not realizing it would be our last moment together. Days passed, and then suddenly, she vanished without a trace, leaving everyone wondering where she had gone. The uncertainty and the absence of closure weighed heavily on my heart. I searched tirelessly for her, trying everything I could to find any clue or information, but my efforts yielded no answers.

I began hallucinating her presence, seeing her in familiar places and hearing her voice in my mind. The pain of missing her became overwhelming, and her memory haunted me every day. Even now, I don't know where she is, but I hope she is happy, blessed, and safe.

And that's how this story remains ongoing. I still yearn to know where she is, what happened, why she left, and many more questions for answers—why, what, where—questions left unanswered. But I've come to accept that some things may never be answered in this lifetime.

I don't know why. I don't know what happened. I don't know where she is right now. It remains a mystery, a tale woven with unanswered questions that echo in my heart. I don't know. I don't know why.....

I hope she finds happiness, blessings, and safety wherever she may be…

God please keep her safe and happy always... ✨

Thank You...♡...
