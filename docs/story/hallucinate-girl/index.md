# The Hallucinate Girl

* July 18, 2024 ✨

This story is about my college days and a special female friend. One day, she left college and vanished from my life without saying a word. Her sudden departure left a deep void in my life. I searched for her tirelessly, trying everything I could to find her, but I couldn't find any answers. I began to hallucinate her presence, seeing her in familiar places and hearing her voice in my mind. The pain of missing her was overwhelming, and her memory haunted me every day. **"The Hallucinate Girl"** captures the emotional journey of losing a dear friend and the lingering impact she had on my heart.

Today, on **July 18th 2024**, as I reflect on this story, I remember her with both a smile and pain.

This story is never-ending, but I write it as much as possible—as a friend, as a human, as a true lover from my perspective.

In **September 2022**, I embarked on my journey at a private engineering college, commencing on October 19, 2022. The first day was nerve-wracking, filled with excitement and a hint of uncertainty. As classes began, I eagerly connected with new friends, each face bringing a sense of camaraderie and possibility to my college journey.

After a few days, November began, and that's when I met a friend. She was always helpful but quiet, as if she carried a story she didn't share with everyone. Getting to know her felt like discovering a hidden treasure, deepening our bond quietly yet significantly, filling my days with gratitude and a longing to understand her more. Sometimes I would ask, but she never opened up to me. And so life went on. November passed, then December, and many more months followed, with her untold story lingering in the background.

**August 30, 2023**, marked our final conversation, I had my last conversation with her, not realizing it would be our final moment together. Days passed, and then suddenly, she vanished without a trace, leaving everyone wondering where she had gone. The uncertainty and the absence of closure weighed heavily on my heart. I searched tirelessly for her, trying everything I could to find any clue or information, but my efforts yielded no answers. 

I began hallucinating her imagine her presence, seeing her in familiar places and hearing her voice in my mind. The pain of missing her became overwhelming, and her memory haunted me every day. Even now, I don't know where she is, but I hope she is happy, blessed, and safe. 

And that's how this story remains ongoing. I still yearn to know where she is, what happened, why she left, and many more questions, for answers—why, what, where—questions left unanswered. But I've come to accept that some things may never be answered in this lifetime.

I don't know why. I don't know what happened. I don't know where she is right now.  It remains a mystery, a tale woven with unanswered questions that echo in my heart.... I don't know. I don't know why... 

My hope is that she finds happiness, blessings, and safety wherever she may be...

Thank God, please keep her safe and happy always... ✨
